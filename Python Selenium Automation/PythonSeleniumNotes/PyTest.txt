# any pytest file will start with test_ or end with _test
#pytest method starts with test_
#any code should be wrapped in method always

Run: 
1. all test cases : py.test
2. all test cases with more info : py.test -v 
3. all test cases with more info and logs in output : py.test -v -s 
4. specific file : py.test <filename> -v -s
5. execute specific method : -k <part of method name> 
				e.g . py.test -k CreditCard -v -s (2 methods are there GreetCreditCard,AxisCreditCard)


1. want to skip a specific test - mark as @pytest.mark.skip -> execution= py.test -v -s
2. want to smoke test - @pytest.mark.smoke -> execution= py.test -m smoke -v -s
3. want to perform test but it may fail so don't want its result (skip reporting in reporting file) - @pytest.mark.xfail -> execution= py.test -v -s
