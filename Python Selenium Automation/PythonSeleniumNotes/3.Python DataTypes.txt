functions vs methods
-> functions are written independently, when it's written inside class, it's called method.

OOPS Concept ::::

constructor -> called as soon as object is created . def __init__(self):
								print("constructor")
		here self is object which we create for the particular class outside of that class. 
		if we pass any parameter inside object then we have to create instance variable inside constructor and also declare arguements after self which will accept those parameter values. 

		eg :
		class Calculator:
		    num =110    # class variable -not impacted with object creation 
		    def __init__(self,a,b):
				self.frstno = a # frstno and secondno are instance variable
				self.secondno = b
		     def sum(self):
			return self.frstno +self.secondno+ Calculator.num Or self.num
		obj = Calculator(2,3) #obj is self, 2 goes to a, 3 goes to b.
		obj.sum()
	
SELF -> its like global and universal to call any variable class/instance.
